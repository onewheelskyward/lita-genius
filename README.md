<lita> Drake first used this moniker in “Jodeci Freestyle” — a single released in the lead-up to his album Nothing Was The Same.  On the album, the phrase is also referenced in “From Time”, during a monologue by Baka. Over time Drake has made the line a recurring theme in songs such as “0 to 100”. “Know yourself”/know thyself is also an aphorism that has been attributed to a number of ancient Greek sages, including Socrates, Heraclitus and Pythagoras. Care first about the greatest perfection of the soul. — Socrates
